# Readme Generator
## I wanted an application that could generate a readme me using the inquirer package. So this is my version of that. I've learned a lot during this build, like file sytem to get it write new files, Inquirer to get the users input to write to a new file. 
## to use this app open the intergrated terminal and run node index. Then answer the questions. It will then write a README_sample file.
